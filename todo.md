# to do list

- typescript

- empty column header in papa parse
- table: highlight matched headers
- can access the filtered data from table?

- visual cues as to what should be the next step
- self-contained demo
- tooltips (with parcimony)
- download graph data as csv/excel + fullscreen

- load should refresh terminal steps and all

advanced ideas:
- Detailed show-up (per AL/Flight groups) (each group have profile and showup)
- Pax ratio and bags ratio (per Airlines/Flight groups)
- Histogram view for queueing time distribution
- Different processing time for Pax at the same process (eg. Bag drop vs 1step at the same counter)

things to improve in the future:
- Order of process and steps managed
- reorganize show-up charts (move up, down, first, last)
- editable LoS parameters
