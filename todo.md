# data validation

# Define validation scheme
- flight number: has a space
- flight date : is a date
- Scheduled time: is a time
- Arr./Dep: in ['A','D']
- Int./Dom: in ['I','D']
- T1/T2 in ['T1','T2']
- Category in ['P','C',...]
- Seats is number

# If all columns are matched


# Click to check validity for all data

- new headers
- validation activated
- filtered on error rows

# Filter on rows with error
# Edit and update filters
