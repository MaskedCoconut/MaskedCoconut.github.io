# to do list

- typescript

- empty column header in papa parse
- table: highlight matched headers

- default schedule, process, show-up

- visual cues as to what should be the next step
- tooltips (with parcimony)
- icons
- Design Day Highlight Card

- fix cases when initial value of select is wrong (showup)
- no input on route if only one child
- reorganize show-up charts (move up, down, first, last)

- load should refresh terminal steps and all
- change in % should recalculate results

advanced ideas:
- Detailed show-up (per AL/Flight groups) (each group have profile and showup)
- Pax ratio and bags ratio (per Airlines/Flight groups)
- Histogram view for queueing time distribution
- Different processing time for Pax at the same process (eg. Bag drop vs 1step at the same counter)
